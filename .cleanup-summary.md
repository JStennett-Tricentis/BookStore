# AI Hub References Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

Removed all AI Hub-specific files and references from the BookStore project. AI Hub was the original project this was based on, but keeping those files was confusing.

## Files Deleted

### Postman Collections (simulations/postman/)
- `AI-Hub-Tests.postman_collection.json` 
- `AI-Hub-Region-Environment-Tests.postman_collection.json`
- `AI-Hub-CSV-Data-Driven.postman_collection.json`

## Files Renamed

### Documentation (docs/)
- `AI_HUB_SIMULATOR_ANALYSIS.md` → `BOOKSTORE_SIMULATOR_ANALYSIS.md`

## Files Updated

### Documentation
1. **docs/TRICENTIS_API_SIMULATOR_PLAN.md**
   - Line 40: "AI Hub API mock" → "BookStore API mock"

2. **docs/BOOKSTORE_SIMULATOR_ANALYSIS.md** (formerly AI_HUB_SIMULATOR_ANALYSIS.md)
   - Updated title and executive summary to clarify this analyzes the original AI Hub for BookStore integration
   - Historical references to AI Hub remain as they document the source project

3. **simulations/postman/REGION-ENVIRONMENT-TESTING.md**
   - Line 56: "AI-Hub-Region-Environment-Tests" → "BookStore-API-Region-Environment-Tests"
   - Line 380: Newman command updated to use BookStore naming

## Current State

### ✅ Clean BookStore Files
- `tests/postman/` - BookStore API Simulator Postman collection
- `simulations/postman/` - BookStore API Simulator Postman collection  
- `simulations/Books/` - BookStore simulation YAML files
- All documentation now refers to "BookStore" or "API Simulator"

### ✅ No Confusion
- No files with "AI-Hub" in the name
- All Postman collections are BookStore-specific
- Documentation clearly identifies when referencing the original AI Hub project vs BookStore

## What This Project Is

**BookStore** - A .NET 8 performance testing application based on the original AI Hub architecture, but focused on a bookstore domain for demonstration purposes.

The API Simulator integration came from AI Hub, which is why some documentation references it as the source implementation.
