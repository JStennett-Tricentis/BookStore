## üìã Common Workflows

### First Time Setup

```bash
make dev-setup
make build
make run-aspire
make seed-data
```

### Run Performance Test with Monitoring

```bash
make docker-observability   # Start monitoring stack
make run-aspire             # Start services
make health-wait            # Wait for services
make seed-data              # Add test data
make perf-load              # Run load test
# View results at http://localhost:3333 (Grafana)
```

### Quick Development Cycle

```bash
make up                     # Start services
make watch                  # Auto-reload on changes
make logs-bookstore         # Monitor logs
```

### Full Stack Testing

```bash
make docker-run             # Start everything in Docker
make health-wait            # Ensure services ready
make perf-comprehensive     # Run all tests
make perf-results          # View results
make docker-clean          # Cleanup
```

### Reset Everything

```bash
make reset                  # Complete cleanup and fresh setup
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Data Loss Commands**: `make docker-clean`, `make reset-db`, and `make reset` will delete data
- **Port Requirements**: Ensure ports 7001-7004, 27017, 6379, 9090, 16686, and 3333 are available
- **Dependencies**: Requires .NET 8 SDK, Docker Desktop, and K6 (for performance tests)
- **Aspire Mode**: Using `make run-aspire` is recommended for development as it manages all dependencies

## üÜò Troubleshooting

| Issue                   | Solution                                             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Port conflicts          | Run `make docker-clean` and check for other services |
| Build failures          | Try `make clean` then `make build`                   |
| Docker issues           | Ensure Docker Desktop is running                     |
| K6 not found            | Run `make install-k6`                                |
| Services not responding | Use `make health-wait` after starting                |

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Aspire for Development**: `make run-aspire` handles all service dependencies automatically
2. **Monitor Performance**: Keep Grafana open during tests at <http://localhost:3333>
3. **Check Status First**: Run `make status` to see what's currently running
4. **Parallel Commands**: Many commands can run simultaneously in different terminals
5. **Use Aliases**: `make up` = `make run-aspire`, `make down` = `make docker-stop`

## üéØ Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Most common commands
make help                   # Show this help
make up                     # Start everything
make status                 # Check what's running
make perf-smoke            # Quick test
make docker-observability   # Launch monitoring
make down                   # Stop everything
make clean                  # Clean build files
```
